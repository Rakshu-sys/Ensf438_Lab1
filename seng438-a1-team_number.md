# Introduction

This lab focused on different software testing methodologies, specifically exploratory and 
manual functional testing. Before this lab, we understood exploratory testing as an unscripted 
testing approach where testers freely navigate the application to discover defects. we also knew 
manual functional testing as a structured testing approach, where predefined test cases are 
executed to validate system functionality against requirements.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing was used to evaluate the ATM simulation system without following 
predefined test cases. This method allowed testers to freely interact with the system, observing 
its behavior and identifying possible defects. Unlike manual functional testing, which follows a 
set script, exploratory testing is flexible and adapts as new issues are discovered.
To keep the testing process organized, the system was broken down into key functions:

• System startup and shutdown
• Card validation and PIN entry
• Withdrawals, deposits, and transfers
• Balance inquiries
• Transaction failures and errors
• Receipt generation
• Operator functions and logs

Each function was tested individually to ensure comprehensive coverage. Critical areas, such as 
security-related functions (PIN entry and account validation), were tested more thoroughly. The 
team members tested different parts of the system independently and then combined their 
findings to ensure no defects were missed. Peer reviews helped refine defect reports, making sure 
all issues were well-documented and reproducible.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
